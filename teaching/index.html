From 2017-2019, I taught <a href="https://github.com/Columbia-Intro-Data-Science/APMAE4990-">APM4990 - Introduction to Data Science in Industry</a>. Here are my <a href="APM4990spring2017review.pdf"> teaching reviews.</a>
<br><br>
  
  
  <b>Comments from APM4990 - Introduction to Data Science in Industry:</b>
  <br><br>
  
 <i>- "This is a great introduction to data science industry - hands-on understanding and practices. But it could be
quite challenging to people without strong computer science background. Strongly recommend to put
   computer science as one of the prerequisites for this course."</i>
<br><br>
<i>
- "Liked how the class was structured. Lectures followed by hands on practice/assignments. Also I think the
  overall pace was excellent."</i>
<br><br>
<i>
  - "He did a great job of making difficult material accessible."</i>
  
<br><br>
  
<i>
- "Professor Goldman teaches you all the practical stuff that you would need for a data science job in the real world.
No unnecessary theories nor inapplicable topics, but in-depth understanding and hands-on insights. Epitome of
  practicality in academia."</i>
