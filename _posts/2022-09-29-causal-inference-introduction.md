# Introduction

## What is causal inference?

- Causal inference is about finding **which correlations are causal**. 
- We often need domain expertise to tell us what could possibly cause what. 
- Physical laws have causal, deterministic models. However at the level of user behavior or economics, we need to define these relationships ourselves.
- There is always a "gotcha" - what if people interested in statistics are more likely to read stat blogs?

We recall a quote from Judea Pearl:

"*Data lone will never tell you if the sun caused the rooster to crow or the crow caused the sun to rise*".
